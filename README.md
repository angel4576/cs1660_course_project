# cs1660_course_project
I did not manage to finish the project, so I will just explain what I did in this file.

*Menu*

I wrote a simple JAVA program as the menu for the users to select what service they want to use. 
User can type in their choice, but the functionality of starting the service is not implemented.

*Services*
1. Hadoop
   click the Endpoints link in kubernetes engine and it shows the hadoop dashboard, but the datanode
   was not successfully linked to the namenode.
2. Jupyter
   click the Endpoints link in kubernetes engine and jupyter notebook will start and needs to take
   a token to use it
3. Apache Spark
   click the Endpoints link in kubernetes engine and the spark service will start
4. Sonarqube
    cgoadadgitlick the Endpoints link in kubernetes engine and the sonarqube service will start. It needs
    users to log in where the login and password are both "admin". 
    Failed to link sonar scanner
